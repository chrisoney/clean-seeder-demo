# Seeder Demo

This is just to show you some simple ways to generate seed data

- I removed most of the routes because this is all about the seed data anway
- It's just meant to help you consider the different ways you can make seed data work for you!

Feel free to message me on slack if you want clarification on anything in here.
If you're in Mod 4 and reading this, I hope you enjoyed the lecture! If you're referring back to it in a later module, I bet you're rocking it there too!
