# Seeder Demo

This is just to show you some simple ways to generate seed data

- I also used this project to break express and set up things in a terrible manner
- Really only pay attention to the seed data if you need help with that
- Seriously, I didn't even use nice api routes. It's awful.
- I take no responsibility if you are inspired by something terrible.

Feel free to message me on slack if you want clarification on anything in here.
Hope you're rocking it in the next module!
