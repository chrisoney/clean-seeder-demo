      `The writing is terrible, there are typos everywhere, and the characters are boring.`,
      `The magic system doesn't make any sense.`,
      `The MC is waaaaaaaaay too edgy.`,
      `Whenever the characters are faced with any sort of difficulty at all they just magically solve it with minimum effort.`,

      `Not the worst story I've ever read, but not great either.`,
      `A bit disappointing because I normally enjoy this writer's work.`,
      `Kind of funny, but relies far too much on shock value.`,

    partTwo: [
      `I don't know how much longer I'm going to stick with this story, but I'm not quite ready to give up on it.`,
      `I wouldn't say that it's absolute trash or anything. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea.`,
      `The plot progression is just soooo slow. Other than that, the writing is acceptable.`,
      `The writer just can't seem to settle on what they want to do with the story.`,
      `It's got a lot of potential, but needs some pretty severe editing to make it worthwhile.`,

    partOne: [
      `Not amazing, not terrible. A real middle of the ground story.`,
      `There some editing that needs to be done, but I'm excited for the potential of this story.`,
      `The writer is really finding his stride at this point in the story.`,
      `Almost gave this story a pass, but now I'm glad that I didn't.`,
      `A fun read, but somewhat forgettable.`,
    ],
    partTwo: [
      `The characters are well thought out but sometimes they seem to blend together too much personality-wise.`,
      `The world-building is absolutely fantastic, but other areas in the writing aren't quite up to snuff.`,
      `I really like how it uses text formatting to enhancing the reading experience, but sometimes it's a bit overdone.`,
      `A few of the side-stories seem to kill the pace of the main story, but overall it's not much of a detriment to enjoying it.`,
      `It'd give it a five if it wasn't for some of the jokes falling really flat.`,

      `I can't believe this story hasn't appeared on Popular yet!`,
      `I found this story after one of my favorite authors recommended it, and I'm really glad she did.`,
      `This web serial is one of the few that I would recommend.`,
    ],
    partTwo: [
      `With a little bit more editing, I'd switch my rating to five stars.`,
      `The descriptions of the scenary are just stellar, though the dialogue is a bit cliche.`,
      `The plot hooks are fantastic and the story arcs are almost perfect. The only problem is that they tend to end rather abruptly considering the pace of the rest of the story.`,
      `There are a few inconsistencies that tend to throw off the readers, but if those were fixed I'd have no complaints.`,
      `Regretably, some of the twists in the story are pretty predictable. It's a shame because the rest of the story progression is always so well planned.`,

      `The characters are well-written, the world-building is amazing, and the pace of the plot is flawless.`,
      `This story has twists and turns that you will never expect, and yet it cleverly hides clues throughout the chapters leading up to each one!`,
      `I'm not exaggerating when I say that this may be the best web serial I've ever read.`,
      `There's a reason why this tale is so popular. The author has created a truly unique take on classic magic, and the rest of the writing doesn't disappoint either!`,
